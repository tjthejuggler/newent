-test enough to find bugs
-make the help blurb better
	-give it collapsable sections
-auto fill number of questions based on selected game type
-when first player finishes game, tell them they are waiting on 2nd player
-endgame readout:
   number of questions
   % correct
   % correct with optimal quantum strategy
   % correct with optimal classical strategy?



things to consider:
-there should be a simple UI that is for the laymen, but then another one that
  it can be set to that is more specific language
-if either player does manual, then they choose how many questions will be done 
    and we just use the first that many results of automatic.
