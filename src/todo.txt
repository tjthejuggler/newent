DO THIS NEXT:
-make the help blurb


CLEAN UP NOTES/GET UI IDEAS FROM THEM
-find out which functions are never being used, get rid of them
-combine the really similar functions
-Combine onSliderChangeB and onSliderChangeA
-make subheaders for different sections
-get quantum(auto) working
-auto fill number of questions based on selected game type
-make enter key submit dialogs
  -this is done on the first dialog, copy it to second
-if either player does manual, then they choose how many questions will be done 
    and we just use the first that many results of automatic.
-endgame readout:
   number of questions
   % correct
   % correct with optimal quantum strategy
   % correct with optimal classical strategy?
-when first player finishes game, tell them they are waiting on 2nd player


things to consider:
-there should be a simple UI that is for the laymen, but then another one that
  it can be set to that is more specific language
